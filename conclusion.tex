\section{Conclusion \label{sec:conclusion}}
On the basis of evidence from English and Russian, I have proposed a theory of \textit{only} NPs in which \textit{only} presupposes existence and uniqueness and \textit{the} is a semantically vacuous determiner, rather than the definite article as \citet{cb2015} argue. My proposal has the advantage that it is compatible with Fregean theories of definiteness.
