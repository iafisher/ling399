\section{Critique of \citet{cb2015}\label{sec:coppock-beaver}}
\citet{cb2015} offer an alternative theory of the interpretation of \textit{only} NPs. The cornerstone of their theory is that the definite article encodes a weak uniqueness presupposition, while the indefinite article is an identity function on predicates. Weak uniqueness means uniqueness or non-existence, i.e. if uniqueness is $|P| = 1$ then weak uniqueness is $|P| \le 1$.

\begin{exe}
	\ex $\textit{the} = \lambda P . \lambda x . [\partial(|P| \le 1) \land P(x)]$
	\ex $\textit{a(n)} = \lambda P . P$
\end{exe}

Unlike in a traditional Fregean account, existence is not presupposed by the definite article. A typical definite like \textit{the table} would be given the formula in (\ref{the-table}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{the-table} $\textit{the table} = \lambda x . [ \partial(|\textsc{Table}| \le 1) \land \textsc{Table}(x) ]$
\end{exe}

A consequence of \citeauthor{cb2015}'s definition of the definite article is that definite descriptions are of type $\langle e, t \rangle$. Of course, definite descriptions commonly appear in argument positions where they are of type $e$. To allow for this, \citeauthor{cb2015} propose that the \textsc{Iota} and \textsc{A} type shifts apply in English to yield the proper semantics of definites and indefinites.

\citeauthor{cb2015} distinguish between definiteness, a morphological category signalled by the definite article in English, and determinacy, the property of denoting an individual. In their terminology, negated \textit{only} NPs are definites that are indeterminate (while in my terminology, negated \textit{only} NPs are not definites at all, and a separate concept of determinacy is unnecessary).

Except for \textit{only} NPs, definites in English are always determinate, and indefinites are always indeterminate, so \citeauthor{cb2015} need an account of why \textsc{Iota} can never apply to indefinites, and \textsc{A} can only apply to negated \textit{only} NPs. They account for this with the principles of Maximize Presupposition and Type Simplicity. Informally, Maximize Presupposition states that if there are two possible words whose meanings are identical, then the one with the greater presupposition must be chosen. Per \citeauthor{cb2015}, the indefinite and definite article have the same meaning, but the definite article has an additional presupposition (weak uniqueness).

Concretely, Maximize Presupposition applies to (\ref{helen}) to rule out the undesired derivation where \textsc{Iota} applies to \textit{a chair} to yield an determinate reading. \textsc{Iota} can only apply when existence and uniqueness are met, but if they had been met, then Maximize Presupposition would have forced the choice of \textit{the} instead of \textit{a}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{helen} Helen took a chair.
\end{exe}

Type Simplicity is the preference for simpler types, all else being equal. \textsc{Iota} has type $\langle et, e \rangle$ while \textsc{A} has type $\langle et, \langle et, t \rangle \rangle$, so \textsc{Iota} would be preferred unless its licensing condition (uniqueness) is not met.

Thus the principles of Maximize Presupposition and Type Simplicity ensure that definiteness and determinacy, and indefiniteness and indeterminacy, coincide in English except in the case of negated \textit{only} NPs.

In summary, \citeauthor{cb2015}'s theory of definiteness has the following components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The definite article encodes a weak uniqueness presupposition. The indefinite article is an identity function.
	\item Definite descriptions are fundamentally predicative and have type $\langle e, t \rangle$ before type-shifting.
	\item A DP receives its determinacy or indeterminacy through an \textsc{Iota} or \textsc{A} type-shift.
\end{itemize}

\citeauthor{cb2015}'s theory is more expansive than my proposal in section \ref{sec:my-theory}, because it reimagines definiteness not just for \textit{only} NPs but for all other definite and indefinite expressions as well. One might question whether the universal application of covert type-shifts in English is sufficiently motivated by the evidence of negated \textit{only} NPs, especially considering that there are two perfectly good overt operators, \textit{the} and \textit{a(n)}, which seem to do the same work.

The reason that \citeauthor{cb2015} offer such a wide-ranging proposal is that their counterexamples directly contradict the common account of definiteness in which existence and uniqueness built-in to the definite article. As long as one maintains that \textit{only} NPs are regular definite descriptions, then indeterminate \textit{only} NPs are a flat contradiction.\footnote{\citegen{russell} theory, in which existence and uniqueness are assertions rather than presuppositions, fare better with regards to negated \textit{only} NPs. However, it incorrectly predicts that \textit{only} NPs (and all other definites) should be interpretable when existence is not satisfied.}

However, as I have shown in section \ref{sec:my-theory}, if one abandons the assumption that \textit{only} NPs are proper definites, then no modifications to the theory of definiteness are necessary, and the semantic account of \textit{only} NPs can be formulated in a manner that is consistent with their limited scope of application.
