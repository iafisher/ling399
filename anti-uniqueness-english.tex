\section{\textit{Only} NPs in English \label{sec:anti-uniqueness-english}}
% TODO: Need some substantial work on this section in terms of how I describe what I used to call "anti-uniqueness" effects

\textit{Only} NPs (that is, NPs that contain the exclusive adjective \textit{only}) in the scope of negation lack uniqueness presuppositions, contrary to typical definite descriptions. This section summarizes the data presented in \citet{cb2012b, cb2015}. I follow them in first considering predicative definites, and then argumental definites.

\subsection{Predicative \textit{only} NPs in English}
% TODO: This is not a great intro
As \citet{strawson50} observed, definite descriptions may be used predicatively, as in (\ref{scott}) and (\ref{napoleon}) below, where \textit{the greatest French soldier} is not used to mention an individual but to attribute a property to Napoleon.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{napoleon} Napoleon was the greatest French soldier.
\end{exe}

(\ref{scott}), repeated below, is a typical example of an \textit{only} NP in the predicate position.

\begin{exe}
	\exr{scott} Scott is not the only author of \textit{Waverley}.
\end{exe}

Suppose a fictional context where the novel \textit{Waverley} was written by a committee comprising Scott, Macfarlane and Campbell, in which case (\ref{scott}) would be a true utterance. In such a context, the phrases \textit{author of Waverley} and \textit{only author of Waverley} denote the sets (\ref{def-author}) and (\ref{def-only-author}). In other words, \textit{author of Waverley} is the set of individuals who are authors of \textit{Waverley}, and \textit{only author of Waverley} is the set of individuals who are ``only authors'' of \textit{Waverley}. Since in this context there are by definition no ``only authors,'' this set is empty.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{def-author} $\textit{author of Waverley} = \lbrace Scott, Macfarlane, Campbell \rbrace$
	\ex \label{def-only-author} $\textit{only author of Waverley} = \emptyset$
\end{exe}

But if the set denoted by \textit{only author of Waverley} is empty, then what could \textit{the only author of Waverley} denote? In conventional theories of definiteness, the use of a phrase \textit{the P} is only possible if there is a single, unique \textit{P} \citep{horn-abbott-2012}, or in the terminology of sets, if \textit{P} denotes a singleton set.\footnote{Plural definites like \textit{the authors} are outside of the scope of discussion of this thesis.}

In particular, \citet{frege} and \citet{strawson50} have uniqueness as a presupposition for definite descriptions, \citet{russell} has it as an assertion, and \citet{horn-abbott-2012} have it as an implicature.

All these accounts share uniqueness as an essential part of the meaning of the definite article. What is so surprising about the \textit{only} NP in (\ref{scott}) is the absence, and indeed the denial, of uniqueness in an otherwise typical definite description.

\subsection{Argumental \textit{only} NPs in English}
Argumental \textit{only} NPs in the scope of negation similarly lack a uniqueness presupposition. (\ref{only-goal}) is an example. On its most prominent reading, (\ref{only-goal}) entails that multiple goals were scored, including one by Anna, so just as in (\ref{scott}) the description \textit{the only goal} cannot have a referent.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{only-goal} Anna didn't score the only goal.
\end{exe}

% TODO: Consider moving this to section on Russian.
There is a simple diagnostic is available to test the determinacy of an argumental definite (and thus presence or absence of an anti-uniqueness effect). If the definite description fails to denote an individual, then it is not able to serve as the antecedent of a pronoun in a subsequent sentence. The contrast between (\ref{the-goal}) and (\ref{only-goal-multiple}) therefore testifies to the presence of an anti-uniqueness effect in (\ref{only-goal}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{the-goal} Anna didn't score [ the goal ]_1. It_1 was an excellent strike.
	\ex \label{only-goal-multiple} Anna didn't score [ the only goal ]_1. \#It_1 was an excellent strike.
\end{exe}

Note that (\ref{only-goal}) is actually ambiguous between a reading where one goal was scored by someone other than Anna and a reading where multiple goals were scored, including one by Anna. Under the one-goal reading, \textit{the only goal} does have a referent and therefore should be able to be a pronoun's antecedent, while it should not be under the multiple-goals reading. (\ref{only-goal-ambig-one}) and (\ref{only-goal-ambig-multiple}) use additional context to tease apart the two readings and validate the predictions.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{only-goal-ambig-one} \textbf{One-goal reading} \\ Anna didn't score [ the only goal ]$_1$, Maria did. It$_1$ was an excellent strike.
	\ex \label{only-goal-ambig-multiple} \textbf{Multiple-goals reading} \\ Anna didn't score [ the only goal ]$_1$, Maria also scored. \#It$_1$ was an excellent strike.
\end{exe}

Only verbs of creation cause \textit{only} NPs to shed their uniqueness presupposition. When \textit{see} is substituted for \textit{score}, as in (\ref{see-only-goal}), then the referential use of \textit{the only goal} is forced; (\ref{see-only-goal}) can only mean that there was a single goal.\footnote{The multiple-goals reading is still possible with heavy emphasis on \textit{only}, as in: \begin{exe} \ex Anna didn't see the ONLY goal. There was more than one. \end{exe} This example will be discussed further in section \ref{sec:my-theory}.}

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{see-only-goal} Anna didn't see the only goal. \# Vera saw one, too.
\end{exe}

The term ``verbs of creation'' in this context must be understood in a broad sense, because verbs like \textit{bring} that do not exactly involve acts of creation nonetheless lack an existence entailment:

\begin{exe}
	\ex Anna didn't bring the only cake. Vera brought one, too.
\end{exe}

% TODO: Better phrase than "the relevant verbs"
\citet{cb2015} note that the relevant verbs all follow the inference pattern in (\ref{verb-of-creation}.) (\ref{not-verb-of-creation}) shows that the pattern fails for \textit{see}, which is why (\ref{see-only-goal}) does has only a referential reading of \textit{the only goal}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{verb-of-creation} There were ten cakes, and then Anna brought one, making eleven.
	\ex \label{not-verb-of-creation} \# There were ten goals, and then Anna saw one, making eleven.\footnote{Some of the strangeness of (\ref{not-verb-of-creation}) could be mitigated by replacing \textit{goal} with \textit{bird} and imagining a context where Anna was on a bird-spotting trip. But such a usage of \textit{saw} involves a notion of bringing something into the realm of first-hand knowledge, and, as predicted, would allow for a non-referential reading of \textit{the only bird}: \begin{exe} \ex Anna didn't see the only bird. Vera saw one, too. \end{exe} }
	% TODO: Footnote about how "seeing a bird" could complicate this pattern?
\end{exe}
