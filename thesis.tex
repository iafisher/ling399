\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an analysis of DP-internal \textit{only} in English and Russian. I review the evidence that \citet{cb2012b, cb2015} present for definites containing \textit{only} that do not presuppose uniqueness, and supplement it with data from Russian. Building on this empirical foundation, I propose that DP-internal \textit{only} presupposes existence and entails uniqueness, and the determiner \textit{the} that selects for \textit{only} is semantically vacuous. As a consequence, DPs containing \textit{only}, like indefinites, are never of type $e$. I show that this analysis is compatible with a Fregean theory of definiteness, unlike \citegen{cb2015} theory. I also present evidence that the DP-internal and adverbial usages of \textit{only} correspond to a single lexical item.
