\title{DP-internal \textit{only} in English and Russian}

\begin{abstract}
This thesis draft presents an analysis of DP-internal \textit{only} in English and Russian. I review the evidence that \citet{cb2012b, cb2015} present on ``anti-unique'' definites. Building on this empirical foundation, I argue that phrases containing DP-internal \textit{only} are not definites at all. I adopt \citeauthor{cb2015}'s analysis of DP-internal \textit{only} as an operator that presupposes existence and entails uniqueness, but I propose contrary to them that \textit{the} functions as a syntactically required but semantically vacuous determiner when it combines with \textit{only}. Since \textit{the} in such examples is not the definite article, these apparent counterexamples are compatible with Russell's and Frege's theories of definiteness. I show that this analysis of DP-internal \textit{only} may be reconciled with adverbial \textit{only} into a single lexical item.
