\section{Anti-uniqueness effects in Russian \label{sec:anti-unique-ru}}
Anti-uniqueness effects are possible in both predicative and argumental definites in Russian, when DP-internal \textit{only} (pronounced as \textit{edinstvennyj} in Russian) is in the scope of negation, just as in English. While there is clear evidence of argumental anti-uniqueness, Russian speakers have mixed judgments on sentences with \textit{edinstvennyj} in the object position. In the idiolects of some spekaers, anti-uniqueness effects do not arise in sentences whose English counterparts do have them. Additionally, argumental anti-uniqueness effects are possible even with verbs of non-creation in Russian.

\subsection{Predicative anti-uniqueness in Russian}
Definite descriptions can be predicative in Russian, as (\ref{pred-def}) shows.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{pred-def} \gll Dmitrij --- vysokij, simpati\v{c}nyj, i (samyj umnyj student vo vs\"{e}m universitete / *Boris).\\
	Dmitri {} tall cute and most smart student in all university {} Boris\\
	\glt `Dmitri is tall, cute and (the smartest student in the whole university / Boris).'
\end{exe}

Assuming that (a) adjectives are of type $\langle e, t \rangle$ and proper names are of type $e$ in Russian, and (b) conjuncts must have the same semantic type, then the ability of a definite description in (\ref{pred-def}) to conjoin with an adjective, and the inability of a proper name to do so, indicates that definites can have type $\langle e, t \rangle$. The equivalent sentence without conjunction is grammatical (see (\ref{dmitri-boris})), so it is crucially the adjectival conjunction that renders the sentence with \textit{Boris} ungrammatical.\footnote{That is, the sentence is ungrammatical on an equative reading where \textit{Boris} has type $e$. It does have a grammatical reading where \textit{Boris} is taken to denote a set of properties associated with ``Boris-ness'', similarly to \textit{such-a} phrases in English: \begin{exe} \ex He's such a Boris.\end{exe} Russian speakers may find the reading more accessible with a name like \textit{Putin} that is more easily given a property reading. Since this property-denoting interpretation of \textit{Boris} plausibly has type $\langle e, t \rangle$, its grammaticality supports my assertion.} Note that the superlative \textit{samyj umnyj student} `smartest student' was used to force the determinate interpretation, since superlatives inherently cannot be indeterminate but regular bare nominals can be.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{dmitri-boris} \gll Dmitrij --- (samyj umnyj student vo vs\"{e}m universitete / Boris).\\
	Dmitri {} most smart student in all university {} Boris\\
	\glt `Dmitri is (the smartest student in the whole university / Boris).'
\end{exe}

It has therefore been established that definite descriptions can be predicates in Russian. Do Russian predicative definites exhibit anti-uniqueness effects? (\ref{tolstoy}) indicates that they do.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{tolstoy} \gll Tolstoj ne edinstvennyj avtor \textit{Vojny i mira}\\
	Tolstoy not only author \textit{War and Peace}\\
	\glt `Tolstoy is not the only author of \textit{War and Peace}.'
\end{exe}

(\ref{tolstoy}) has the same meaning as its English translation. It presupposes that Tolstoy is an author of \textit{War and Peace} (since (\ref{tolstoy}) without negation still entails that he is an author of \textit{War and Peace}) and asserts that one or more others are also authors. Therefore, \textit{edinstvennyj avtor Vojny i mira} `the only author of \textit{War and Peace}' fails to refer to an individual, just as in English, and an anti-uniqueness effect arises.

\subsection{Argumental anti-uniqueness in Russian}
The basic pattern of argumental anti-uniqueness in English holds in Russian as well: nominals in the scope of negation modified by \textit{edinstvennyj} cannot be interpreted as determinate.

The basic paradigm is established by (\ref{anti-unique-ru})-(\ref{anti-unique-ru-last}). The second sentence in each example, separated for clarity, should be read as a continuation of the first. (\ref{anti-unique-ru}) and (\ref{anti-unique-ru-2}) both entail a single lecture, so \textit{edinstvennuju lekciju} `the only lecture' is determinate and the pronoun \textit{ona} `it' in the continuation sentence can refer to it.

(\ref{anti-unique-ru-last}) entails multiple lectures, so \textit{edinstvennuju lekciju} should be indeterminate and, as predicted, the pronoun in the continuation sentence cannot refer to it.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{anti-unique-ru} \begin{xlist}
		\ex \gll Anna posetila edinstvennuju lekciju, kotoruju pro\v{c}ital Xomskij, kogda byl v na\v{s}em universitete.\\
		Anna attended only lecture which gave Chomsky when was at our university\\
		\glt `Anna went to the only lecture that Chomsky gave at our university.'
		
		\ex \gll Ona byla o lingvistike.\\
		it was about linguistics\\
		\glt `It was about linguistics.'
	\end{xlist}
	
	\ex \label{anti-unique-ru-2} \begin{xlist}
		\ex \gll Anna ne posetila edinstvennuju lekciju, kotoruju pro\v{c}ital Xomskij, kogda byl v na\v{s}em universitete.\\
		Anna not attended only lecture which gave Chomsky when was at our university\\
		\glt `Anna didn't go to the only lecture that Chomsky gave at our university.'
		
		\ex \gll Ona byla o lingvistike.\\
		it was about linguistics\\
		\glt `It was about linguistics.'
	\end{xlist}
	
	\ex \label{anti-unique-ru-last} \begin{xlist} 
		\ex \gll Anna posetila ne edinstvennuju lekciju, kotoruju pro\v{c}ital Xomskij, kogda byl v na\v{s}em universitete.\\
		Anna attended not only lecture which gave Chomsky when was at our university\\
		\glt `Anna went to one of the lectures Chomsky gave at our university.'
		
		\ex \gll \# Ona byla o lingvistike.\\
		{} it was about linguistics\\
		\glt `It was about linguistics.'
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The Russian data is more complicated than the tidy contrast in (\ref{anti-unique-ru})-(\ref{anti-unique-ru-last}) would suggest, however. For one thing, some speakers \textit{do} permit the continuation in (\ref{anti-unique-ru-last}). This phenomenon will be addressed in section \ref{sec:no-anti-unique}. For another, some speakers find (\ref{anti-unique-ru-2}) marginal and prefer to state it as in (\ref{anti-unique-ru-2.1}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{anti-unique-ru-2.1} \gll Ne Anna posetila edinstvennuju lekciju, kotoruju pro\v{c}ital Xomskij, kogda byl v na\v{s}em universitete.\\
	Not Anna attended only lecture which gave Chomsky when was at our university\\
	\glt `It wasn't Anna that went to the only lecture that Chomsky gave at our university.'
\end{exe}

Finally, some speakers interpret (\ref{anti-unique-ru-last}) as entailing that Anna attended more than one of Chomsky's lectures, while others interpret it to mean that she attended only one (but that Chomsky gave more than one).

Despite these caveats, the generalization remains that argumental anti-uniqueness occurs in Russian where \citeauthor{cb2015} predict it would. This generalization is borne out across a range of different verbs and sentences:\footnote{In the examples, the variant corresponding to (\ref{anti-unique-ru-2}) and not (\ref{anti-unique-ru-2.1}) is used for simplicity, but all speakers found one or the other variant grammatical.}

\end{exe}

\subsection{No anti-uniqueness in some dialects \label{sec:no-anti-unique}}
% TODO: Use this section to introduce the problematic data.
As noted previously, not all Russian speakers evince anti-uniqueness in (\ref{anti-unique-ru-last}). That is to say, the combination in (\ref{no-anti-unique}) is grammatical for these speakers.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{no-anti-unique} \begin{xlist}
		\ex \gll Anna posetila ne edinstvennuju lekciju, kotoruju pro\v{c}ital Xomskij, kogda byl v na\v{s}em universitete.\\
		Anna attended not only lecture which gave Chomsky when was at our university\\
		\glt `Anna went to one of the lectures Chomsky gave at our university.'
		
		\ex \gll Ona byla o lingvistike.\\
		it was about linguistics\\
		\glt `It was about linguistics.'
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

In order to express these sentences idiomatically in English, one has to resort to using the indefinite \textit{one of the lectures} in (\ref{no-anti-unique}), but in Russian there is no hint that it is anything other than the regular definite description that is seen in (\ref{anti-unique-ru}) and (\ref{anti-unique-ru-2}).


How can it be that (\ref{no-anti-unique}) entails a multiplicity of lectures and yet allows for a singular reference? The first step towards answering this question is to clarify the syntactic composition of \textit{ne edinstvennyj lekciju} `not (the) only lecture.' The constituent negation particle \textit{ne} must either be outside the DP, as in (\ref{external-ne}), or internal to it, as in (\ref{internal-ne}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{external-ne} Anna posetila ne [_{DP} edinstvennyj lekciju].
	\ex \label{internal-ne} Anna posetila [_{DP} ne edinstvennyj lekciju].
\end{exe}

% TODO: What does the literature on constituent negation say?
% TODO: In fact I think the facts might be easier to explain if ne is external to the DP.

The presence of \textit{edinstvennyj} is crucial to the availability of constituent negation: (\ref{ne-no-edin}), the same sentence without \textit{edinstvennyj}, is ungrammatical.

\begin{exe}
	\ex[*] { \label{ne-no-edin}
		\gll Anna zabila ne gol.\\
		Anna scored not goal\\
	}
\end{exe}

The meaning of (\ref{only-goal-multiple-ru}) indicates that \textit{edinstvennyj} is being negated, since \textit{edinstvennyj} entails singularity while the matrix sentence entails multiplicity. It is not obvious how this semantic relationship and the ungrammaticality of (\ref{ne-no-edin}) could be explained if \textit{ne} where external to the DP. It would appear that the syntactic and semantic properties of \textit{ne edinstvennyj gol} are most easily explained if \textit{ne} and \textit{edinstvennyj} compose directly, implying that \textit{ne} must be internal to the DP since otherwise the phonologically null head of DP would intervene between the two words.

In that case, it must be the DP \textit{ne edinstvennyj gol} that refers to the goal that Anna scored, out of the multiple goals that were scored.

This account raises a serious issue. \textit{Edinstvennyj gol} presumably denotes a singleton set. The negation particle \textit{ne} normally functions as the set complement operation, which means that \textit{ne edinstvennyj gol} ought to denote the complement of a singleton set, which should have more than one element. But a set with more than one element should not be able to be interpreted as determinate.

The difficulty is not so much a matter of an inexpressive theory as a true peculiarity in the facts of the Russian language in this instance. It is quite unusual that \textit{ne edinstvennyj gol} `the not-only goal' can simultaneously entail a multiplicity of goals while denoting a single one.

I suggest two approaches: one which makes use of a selection operation on sets to pick out a singular referent, and one which postulates a multiplicity-singularity division between presupposition and assertion.

What would be required in the semantics to model this peculiarity is some operation to pick out one of the multiplicity of goals. This selection operation, which would extract a singular referent from a multiplicity, must be constrained by the form of the rest of the sentence: \textit{on} (or \textit{\`{e}to}  as the case may be) in (\ref{only-goal-multiple-ru}) may not refer to just any goal that was scored, but specifically the goal that Anna scored.

The idea of a phrase yielding an antecedent other than the set it denotes is not unprecedented in the literature: complement anaphora are just such a phenomenon. A complement anaphor is a pronoun that has as its antecedent the complement of some set previously denoted \citep{nouwen03, schwarz09}. In (\ref{kennedy}), the antecedent of \textit{they} in the second sentence is the complement of \textit{few congressmen}, i.e. few congressmen admire Kennedy so the majority of them think he is incompetent.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{kennedy} Few congressmen admire Kennedy. They think he's incompetent.
\end{exe}

Not all quantifiers allow complement anaphora, though:

\begin{exe}
	\ex A few congressmen admire Kennedy. \#They think he's incompetent.
\end{exe}

The same paradigm occurs in Russian as well:

\begin{exe}
	\ex \gll Malo kto iz kongressmenov vosxi\v{s}\v{c}aetsja Kennedi. Oni dumajut, \v{c}to on neumelyj.\\
	Few who from congressmen admire Kennedy they think that he incompetent\\
	\glt `Few congressmen admire Kennedy. They think he's incompetent.'
	\ex \gll Neskol'ko kongressmenov vosxi\v{s}\v{c}ajutsja Kennedi. \#Oni dumajut, \v{c}to on neumelyj.\\
	{A few} congressmen admire Kennedy they think that he incompetent\\
	\glt `A few congressmen admire Kennedy They think he's incompetent.'
\end{exe}

Complement anaphora illustrate that the antecedent of a pronoun need not always be explicitly present in the semantics, as long as it can be derived from some entity that is present. Complement anaphora involve the set complement relationship; the data from Russian suggests that some individual-selection operation on sets may also be available.

% TODO: Rephrase this in terms of alternative sets.
The second possibility is that there is some division of semantic meaning between presupposition and assertion which retains the multiplicity entailment while allowing \textit{ne edinstvennyj gol} to refer to a single goal. That is, the multiplicity entailment would be confined to the presupposition, and the assertive content would therefore contain only a reference to a singular goal. Unfortunately, the presuppositive component of (\ref{only-goal-multiple-ru}) cannot be isolated by negation, because the negated version of the sentence is independently ungrammatical:\footnote{Note that (\ref{only-goal-multiple-ru}) is an affirmative sentence, as the negation particle \textit{ne} does not have sentential scope.}

\begin{exe}
	\ex[*] { \label{double-neg}
		\gll Anna ne zabila ne edinstvennyj gol.\\
		Anna not scored not only goal\\
		\glt Intended: `Anna didn't score any of the goals.'
	}
\end{exe}

The presumed meaning of (\ref{double-neg}) would be, as the English gloss suggests, that multiple goals were scored, and Anna didn't score any of them. In that case, the presupposition and assertion of (\ref{only-goal-multiple-ru}) would be as follows:

\begin{exe}
	\ex Anna zabila ne edinstvennyj gol. \begin{xlist}
		\ex Presupposition: Multiple goals were scored.
		\ex Assertion: Anna scored a goal.
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

It would seem then that the reference of \textit{ne edinstvennyj gol} is relative to the assertion, while the multiplicity entailment is actually a presupposition.

The two approaches I have proposed are not incompatible. It could be that the set selection operation is sensitive to the assertion-presupposition distinction. In any case, I hope to have made the ability of \textit{ne edinstvennyj gol} to imply multiple goals but denote a single one a little less puzzling.
