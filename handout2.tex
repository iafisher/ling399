\section{My thesis}
An analysis of some interesting semantic and syntactic properties of DP-internal \textit{only} in English and in Russian.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Indeterminate readings
	\item Anti-uniqueness effects \citep{cb2015}
	\item \textbf{Negative polarity item licensing}
\end{itemize}

\section{DP-internal \textit{only} and NPIs}
Downward-entailment (canonical environment for negative-polarity items):

\begin{exe}
	\ex $P(x)$ is a downward-entailing environment if $P(S)$ implies $P(S')$ for all subsets $S'$ of $S$.
\end{exe}

\noindent DP-internal \textit{only} licenses NPIs:

\begin{exe}
	\ex The only car he \textbf{ever} owned was a Subaru Legacy.
	\ex \gll Ivan vzjal edinstvennuju knigu, kotoruju \textbf{kto-libo} xotel.\\
	Ivan took only book which anybody wanted\\
	\glt `Ivan took the only book that anybody wanted.'
\end{exe}

\noindent Does DP-internal \textit{only} create a downward-entailing environment?

\begin{exe}
	\ex The only mountain greater than 29,000 feet tall is Everest.
	\ex The only mountain greater than 30,000 feet tall is Everest.
	\ex The only book in the library written by a Russian is already checked out.
	\ex The only book in the library written by Gogol is already checked out.
\end{exe}
