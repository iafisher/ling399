# DP-internal only in English and Russian
My undergraduate thesis in linguistics at Haverford College, December 2018. The final PDF version of the thesis can be found at `pdf/thesis.pdf`.

## Abstract
This paper presents an analysis of DP-internal *only* in English and Russian. I review the evidence in Coppock and Beaver (2012b, 2015) for definites containing *only* that do not presuppose uniqueness, and supplement it with data from Russian. Building on this empirical foundation, I propose that DP-internal *only* presupposes existence and asserts uniqueness, and the determiner *the* in *the only* constructions is semantically vacuous. As a consequence, DPs containing *only*, like indefinites, are never of type *e*. I also present evidence that the DP-internal and adverbial usages of *only* correspond to a single lexical item.
