\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my student readers Courtney Dalton and Davy Qi and my second faculty reader Professor Ted Fernald for their helpful feedback on my drafts.

Barbara Partee and Richard Larson were kind enough to sit down with me and discuss my ideas. This project owes much to their illuminating suggestions.

I am grateful to my Russian language consultants, Alexandr Trubetskoy, Maxim Sonin, Sophie Chochaeva, and Ivan Tseytlin, for their patience and generosity in sharing their language with me.

Most of all, I thank my tireless faculty advisor Professor Shizhe Huang, whose feedback and support have been invaluable not only in the writing of this thesis but throughout the course of my studies at Haverford.
