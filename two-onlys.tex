\section{DP-internal \textit{only} and adverbial \textit{only} \label{sec:two-onlys}}
So far in this paper I have exclusively discussed the so-called ``DP-internal'' usage of the word \textit{only}. There is also a more common usage which I will term ``adverbial \textit{only}'' for convenience.\footnote{Although \textit{only} in fact has a different distribution than other adverbs, for example: \begin{exe} \ex (Only/*Quickly) John finished the race. \ex John finished the race (*only/quickly). \end{exe} The exact syntactic status of this usage of \textit{only} is not clear.} An example of the adverbial usage is (\ref{adverb-only}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{adverb-only} Only Omar takes the bus.
\end{exe}

DP-internal and adverbial \textit{only} share many properties, including the basic inference pattern of existence and uniqueness and the licensing of negative polarity, but also differ in some respects, notably in that adverbial \textit{only} more reliably induces an alternative set.

\subsection{Cross-linguistic perspective}
We have seen that DP-internal \textit{only} is translated as \textit{edinstvennyj} in Russian. Adverbial \textit{only} corresponds to a different lexical item, \textit{tol'ko}:

\begin{exe}
	\ex \gll Tol'ko studenty pri\v{s}li.\\
	\textbf{only} students came\\
	\glt `Only the students came.'
\end{exe}

The same lexical distinction is made in Spanish and German \citep{mcnally08} and Chinese (Shizhe Huang, p.c.). On the other hand, French uses the same word, \textit{seul}:\footnote{I thank Ma\"{e}lys G\"{u}ck for this data. French also has an adverb \textit{seulement}, morphologically derived from \textit{seul}, which corresponds to some usages of adverbial \textit{only} in English.}

\begin{exe}
	\ex \gll Seuls les \'{e}tudiants sont venus.\\
	Only the students are came\\
	\glt `Only the students came.'
	\ex \gll Julia a \'{e}crit le seul bon essai.\\
	Julia has written the only good essay\\
	\glt `Julia wrote the only good essay.'
\end{exe}

English is therefore not unique in having a single lexical item for DP-internal and adverbial \textit{only}, but the presence of a lexical distinction in a number of languages, including some that are genealogically unrelated, suggests that deeper differences in the meaning of the two usages may be present.

\subsection{Alternative sets}
Alternative sets are a fundamental part of the semantics of adverbial \textit{only}. We have seen in (\ref{sec:no-anti-unique}) that alternative sets may explain some intriguing data from Russia with DP-internal \textit{only} as well. However, they do not seem to be universally present with DP-internal \textit{only}. (\ref{raj-cookie}), for instance, does not seem to involve any kind of alternative set. It is synonymous with the equivalent sentence without \textit{only}, except with an extra emphasis on uniqueness. But there is no implication of any alternatives to the cookie that Raj ate.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{raj-cookie} Raj ate the only cookie.
\end{exe}

\subsection{Negative polarity items and downward entailment}
As a brief aside, it is worth considering whether DP-internal \textit{only} licenses a downward entailment as NPI licensers are conventionally assumed to do. A downward entailment holds when a predicate that is true for a superset is also necessarily true for any subset. Sentential negation is the canonical example of a downward-entailing environment, as the entailment from the superset \textit{reptiles} in (\ref{reptiles}) to the subset \textit{snakes} in (\ref{snakes}) shows.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{reptiles} No reptiles give birth to live young.
	\ex \label{snakes} No snakes give birth to live young.
\end{exe}

DP-internal \textit{only} only licenses NPIs within its DP, so that is the relevant position to look for a downward entailment. The evidence initially suggests that DP-internal \textit{only} does not create an downward entailment. (\ref{everest-29}) does not entail (\ref{everest-30}), although the set of mountains taller than 30,000 feet is clearly a subset of the set of mountains taller than 29,000 feet. (\ref{russian-book}) does not necessarily entail (\ref{gogol-book})---suppose the only book in the library written by an Russian was actually by Turgenev---even though Gogol is in the set of all Russians.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{everest-29} The only mountain greater than 29,000 feet tall is Everest.
	\ex \label{everest-30} The only mountain greater than 30,000 feet tall is Everest.
	\ex \label{russian-book} The only book in the library written by a Russian is already checked out.
	\ex \label{gogol-book} The only book in the library written by Gogol is already checked out.
\end{exe}

However, I do not think that (\ref{everest-29})-(\ref{gogol-book}) constitute a knock-down argument against DP-internal \textit{only}'s downward monotonicity. The failure of the superset sentence to entail the subset sentence stems solely from the possibility of the definite description failing to refer. In other words, (\ref{everest-29}) does in fact entail (\ref{everest-30}) and (\ref{russian-book}) does (\ref{gogol-book}), so long as the definite descriptions \textit{the only mountain greater than 30,000 feet} and \textit{the only book in the library that was written by Gogol} have referents. It is never possible for (\ref{everest-29}) to be true and (\ref{everest-30}) to be false. If (\ref{everest-29}) is true, then (\ref{everest-30}) is either true or undefined.

Nevertheless, other downward-entailing operators do not carry an existence requirement: (\ref{reptiles}) entails (\ref{iguanas}) regardless of whether or not such a creature as a four-toed frilled iguana actually exists.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{iguanas} No four-toed frilled iguanas give birth to live young.
\end{exe}

The source of this discrepancy is of course the definite article (or the \textsc{Iota} shift, per \citeauthor{cb2015}), which causes the entire sentence to have an undefined truth value if its NP complement is not a singleton set.

In short, DP-internal \textit{only} creates a downward entailment (though still subject to the uniqueness requirement of the definite article), and thus the NPI-licensing properties of \textit{only} and \textit{edinstvennyj} fit neatly into the classical paradigm.
